# Pi Continuity

**Keep useful context. Keep the way back.**

Pi Continuity helps long-running [Pi Coding Agent](https://github.com/earendil-works/pi)
sessions manage noisy tool output, recover evidence, and carry goals, constraints,
decisions and unfinished work through compaction. Pi owns the session lifecycle;
this extension adds context hygiene and continuity policies around it.

> **Pi Continuity is the product name; `pi-smart-compact` is the package.**
> `/smart-compact`, `smart_*` tools and `smartCompact` settings are unchanged.
> The TUI still says **Smart Compact**. No data or configuration migration is
> needed. [Identity and naming](./docs/identity.md).
>
> **Pi Continuity 10.1.0:** upgrading from 9.x? Update Pi to 0.87.1 or newer
> and read the [upgrade notes](./docs/guide.md#upgrade-from-9x). Optional memory
> engines and image rendering are installed separately. The
> [changelog](./CHANGELOG.md) records the full release and its evidence limits.
> These defaults (pressure-first cleanup, eager tool exposure, native tool
> rows) ship with 10.1.0.

## Fork: disabled for OpenAI Codex

This fork disables Smart Compact (including the optional `rtk` entry point) when
Pi's **active provider is exactly `openai-codex`**. It uses the actual
`session_start` context model, not `settings.defaultProvider` or a GPT model-name
heuristic. An unknown model fails closed. Before that event, only the provider
lifecycle gate is registered: no original initialization, tools, commands,
shortcuts, context/provider hooks, or compaction takeover. GPT models served by
other providers remain supported.

Switching an initialized runtime to Codex (or an unknown model) aborts its
lifetime, runs shutdown cleanup, removes its tools from the active set, and
re-registers them as `hidden`. Existing callbacks are guarded, including late
registrations. **Pi has no tool-unregister API**: these old registrations and
inert commands still exist until `/reload`; they are not physically deleted.
Reload while using Codex for strictly zero Smart Compact tool/command
registrations. Native Pi compaction is unaffected.

Switching back does **not** restart a shut-down runtime or reconstruct its old
tool exposure/active set. Select the supported provider, then **`/reload`** to
initialize a fresh runtime from the normal settings/session state. The same
reload is required when switching away from a disabled cold start. No automatic
restore is claimed; already-completed work is not rolled back.

## What it does

| Task | Use | Boundary |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Reduce old tool-output noise | **Context hygiene**: archive eligible output behind retrievable references | Protected instructions, failures and recent work stay in context. |
| Finish a research detour | **Checkpoint and rewind**: retain a report and a path back to evidence | Not a filesystem or side-effect rollback. |
| Make room for the next stage | **Verified compaction**: extract working state, synthesize a bounded summary, check it before apply | Verification catches known gaps; it does not guarantee semantic truth. |
| Revisit a milestone | **Session navigation**: named anchors, read-only cross-session search, return on a new branch with carryover | Files, processes and external services are unchanged. |
| Continue in a fresh session | **Handoff**: seed a new session from recorded state, without a model call | Not a new summary of the entire transcript; parent evidence remains retrievable. |
| Reuse an approved fact | **Project memory**: scoped recall through one selected backend | Separate from session state, output archives and backups. |

The goal is a smaller **working set**, not an inaccessible history. Compaction
uses **Extract → Explore → Synthesize → Verify (EESV)**; exploration depends on
the mode, and verification is primarily deterministic.
[How it works](./docs/guide.md#how-it-works-in-one-minute) · [Architecture](./ARCHITECTURE.md)

## Get started

Requires **Pi 0.87.1+** and **Node.js 22.19+**.

```bash
pi install npm:pi-smart-compact
```

Then, in Pi's interactive TUI:

```text
/smart-compact
```

Opening Home changes nothing. Without a UI (print, RPC or SDK), the bare command
instead runs a compaction with your configured defaults.

Open **Settings → How it runs** to choose your level of control:

| Preset | Behavior |
| --- | --- |
| **Manual only** | You start compaction or cleanup; no extension-scheduled work. |
| **Manual + agent** | You or the agent can request compaction. |
| **Cleanup only** | Local, recoverable cleanup; no automatic summary generation. |
| **Fully automatic** | Cleanup plus compaction requests when idle at the configured context threshold. |

Pi's own compaction setting is separate. **Pressure-first (default)** keeps
roomy history unchanged, allows cleanup at an early pressure gate, then requests
compaction when idle at 80% if still needed. The optional `native-hook` strategy
participates only when Pi starts compaction. [Trigger settings](./docs/configuration.md).

For your first run, choose **Compact now**, inspect the plan, then review the
result. **A** applies it; **C** or **Esc** cancels. **Enter does not apply** on
the review screen. Approval is required unless you explicitly disable
`requireApproval`.

### Optional components

A normal Pi install does **not** install these opt-in components. Enable them
only for the feature you need; nothing is downloaded, started or configured on
your behalf.

| Feature (off by default) | Component | Approximate disk use¹ |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Mnemopi memory store | `@oh-my-pi/pi-mnemopi@18.3.1` and its engine packages | 195 MB |
| Mnemopi without Bun 1.3.14+ on `PATH` | `bun@1.4.2` | 60 MB |
| Image snapshots (`visualArchiveEnabled`) | `@resvg/resvg-js@2.6.2` | 3.5 MB |

¹ Measured on macOS arm64; not download sizes or cross-platform guarantees.

**Status & help → Readiness & details** shows the exact install command for a
missing component and your Pi install root. A typical Mnemopi setup is:

```bash
npm install @oh-my-pi/pi-mnemopi@18.3.1 bun@1.4.2 --prefix ~/.pi/agent/npm --legacy-peer-deps
```

Pi uses `--legacy-peer-deps`, so optional peers are not pulled in automatically.
Installing them explicitly records them in that package directory; they survive
`pi update`. For a bun- or pnpm-managed Pi install, use the equivalent add command
in the same directory. [Memory setup](./docs/guide.md#memory-store-memorybackend).

## One Home, five choices

**Compact now** · **Clean up tool output** · **Settings** ·
**History & recovery** · **Status & help**

Use arrows and Enter to navigate, Esc to go back, and **D** for planning or
result details. Home shows context usage and effective permissions; unavailable
actions explain why.

| Direct command | What happens |
| --- | --- |
| `/smart-compact trim` | Queues local cleanup without a model call. The next request is still untrimmed; the edit commits at the next natural completed-turn boundary. |
| `/smart-compact storage` | Reports archived output; never deletes it. A scan cannot prove that an unreferenced artifact is safe to remove. |
| `/smart-compact context` | Opens anchors, cross-session search and branch navigation. |
| `/smart-compact handoff dry-run` | Previews a new-session seed without opening one. Use `handoff [-- note]` to proceed. |
| `/smart-compact metrics` | Shows effective state, run outcomes, recent issues and the host prompt-cache ledger. |

By default permitted agent tools stay visible from session start, avoiding late
schema changes to cached prefixes. Actions, not visibility, are pressure-gated;
read-only recovery and metadata checkpoints remain available while roomy.
Optional lazy loading uses `smart_tools`. The context guide is read on request,
not injected. Tool availability and compaction permission are separate controls.

## Memory is optional; continuity is the core

No remote memory service is needed for session continuity. **Local graph** is
the default for on-machine scoped recall. Choose **Mnemopi** for a separate local
engine, or **Hindsight** for your existing server and bank. Only the selected
backend is read or written; failures never silently fall back to another store.

Explicit saves require confirmation. When enabled, the local graph also indexes
derived state after host-confirmed compactions. None of these stores replaces
session backups or archived tool output.

## Boundaries worth knowing

- **Recovery is bounded.** Rewind does not undo file changes. Archives cannot
  restore bytes omitted before Pi recorded the output.
- **Review the summary.** Extraction and deterministic verification can miss
  information. A verifier score is not a measure of task success.
- **Experimental formats are opt-in.** Provider-native summaries are not
  EESV-verified. Image snapshots need a supported reader and a cost check;
  otherwise text is used.
- **Claude OAuth needs a compatible adapter.** The published
  `pi-claude-oauth-adapter@0.2.2` normalizes Pi's own requests, not all nested
  model-runtime calls. Full coverage needs final-payload normalization
  ([upstream PR #10](https://github.com/minzique/pi-claude-oauth-adapter/pull/10)).
  [Compatibility details](./docs/guide.md#summary-format-provider-compaction-and-images).
- **Cost and quality need live evidence.** Cancelled or discarded preparation
  still costs. Offline pilots do not establish billed savings, model fidelity
  or production readiness. [Evaluation limits](./docs/evaluation.md).
